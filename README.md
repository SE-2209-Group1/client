## About the project

In this project we have tasked with creating a full-stack DFX clone, making sure to include to the front and back-end.
We were given a large range of epic user stories to break down and complete within our teams. 


## Built with

### Front end
ReactJS App with the following imports:

axios (for handling HTTP requests and responses)
Tailwind (css styling import only)
React Router (handling paths within the React App)

<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/react/react-original-wordmark.svg" width="100" >

Testing - Jest with:

testing-library/react
testing-library/user-events
jest.fn() for mocking axios get/post responses.

### Back end

NodeJS server using:

Express (provide web framework for node)
Mongoose (provide connection between server and MongoDB)
body-parser (parsing middleware for handling json req.body)
dotenv (environment variable loading)
cors (cross origin resource sharing package)

Testing - Mocha with:

chai (assertion library)
chai-http (extend chai assertion library with HTTP integration)
Back end (data persistence layer)
MongoDB Atlas

## Getting started

Clone the project and then from the project root directory:

Install the dependencies
```npm i``` // from both the cloned root directory of the front end and back end
Run tests:
```$ npm test```
Run the server
```$ npm start```
Using web browser, navigate to the localhost address/port provided in the server console.

## Product Backlog

We decided to focus our time on the most important element of the DFXtra Application - the Graduate view page. With this in mind, the epic breakdown that we focussed on was:
```
As a graduate user I want to manage my DFXtra 
profile so that I can keep it current.
```
This was broken down into the following Graduate User Epic Breakdown:
```
As a graduate user I want to be able to view my profile so that I can check it for errors and omissions.
```
From these we were able to produce our product backlog, which was broken down into smaller tasks for us to tackle:
```
As a graduate user I want to be able to view my profile so that I can check it for errors and omissions.
As a graduate user I want to be able to edit my profile so that I can add or update information.
```
The profile page was separated into 5 components:

- [X] Header
  - [X] Build a header using Tailwind. 
  - [X] Test that the header is correctly rendered.
- [X] Footer
  - [X] Build a footer using Tailwind.

## Sprint One Backlog

Have the graduate view page fully built, tested, styled, shippable and checked with product owner

## Mocks and Component Hierarchy 

We have used the two wireframes given to us by the product owner and from these we have broken them down into the component hierarchy below.

## Graduate Page

| Components   | Colour                                    |

## Sprint Goals

Goal 1:

"Have the graduate view page fully built, tested, styled, shippable and checked with product owner"

Goal 2: 

"Have the graduate view and edit page fully built, tested, styled, shippable and checked with product owner"

## Project Retro 
- Sprint 0 (planning)
  - We learnt a lot from breaking down the problems into smaller tasks.
  - We discussed time-management honestly and divided our team-engineering time accordingly.  
  - We decided to work using the Agile Methodology:
    - We all agreed that daily stand-ups were a priority, and that all members must be in attendance.
  - We decided to use Miro and Trello for project planning and management. 
    
![Trello](/Images/Trelloproject2.png)

- Sprint 1
  - What went well:
    - Our methods of communication worked really well. 
    - Daily end-of-day reflection meetings were very useful for our team for ensuring that we were on track to achieve our goals. 
    - Daily morning stand-ups were well used. 
    - Regular communication with the product owner. 
  - What to work on for the next sprint:
    - We overestimated how many tasks we could complete in this time (our work velocity).
    - We agreed to consistent code and styling standards for the next sprint for consistency. 
    - We decided to extract lengthy code into smaller components, that were simpler and more reusable.
    - Introduce a developer branch to separate what we were working on, and shippable products. 

- Sprint 2
  - What went well:
    - Working in flexible pair-programming allowed us to share skills and swarm bugs â€“ learnt a lot from other working styles. 
    - We were more realistic with our sprint goal - achieved our 'definition of done'.
    - We worked well as an Agile team, every member was proactive, engaged, reliable, and we communicated effectively through the use of daily stand-ups, group chats, and group reflections.

### Sprint 3 and beyond...
Goals:
- Login/Logout functionality
- Back-end deployment
- Editable summary page
- Begin to tackle other user stories
  - We would speak with the product owner to discuss what tasks to prioritise. 

What would we improve from sprint 2:
- Plan out our databases in even more detail.
